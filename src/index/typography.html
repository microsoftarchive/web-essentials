    <p>
      Typography is very important. It’s the only element that speaks to
      both sides of the brain. It has to be both beautiful and legible.
      Typograpy is what converys our message and outputs our users content.
      As the UI of Wunderlsit continues to take the backseat, we have to
      call on other elements like typography to help carry on our
      character. Lato does this very well. It has a playful but structured
      nature. It has a great x-height is makes reading a breeze and looks
      great on all our platforms.
